            <h2>Echeveria desmetiana.</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Echeveria desmetiana is a charming succulent, known for its thick,
              pointed leaves, which are arranged in compact rosettes. Its color
              ranges from bluish-green to silvery, with pinkish or purplish hues
              on the edges, depending on sun exposure. The texture of its leaves
              is smooth and waxy, giving it an elegant and sophisticated look.
              As for size, Echeveria desmetiana usually reaches about 10 to 15
              centimeters in diameter, making it ideal for decorating small
              spaces. Regarding watering care, Echeveria desmetiana, like most
              succulents, prefers dry soils. Water only when the substrate is
              completely dry, avoiding water accumulation, which can lead to
              root rot. In winter, the watering frequency should be reduced, as
              the plant enters a period of dormancy.

            <hr />
            <p>
              Pachyphytum oviferum, also known as "Moonstone," is a succulent
              that enchants with its plump, rounded leaves covered in a white
              bloom that gives it a silvery, luminous appearance. Its color can
              vary from bluish-green to lilac, with pinkish hues on the edges,
              depending on sun exposure. The texture of its leaves is smooth and
              waxy, making them very pleasant to the touch. As for size,
              Pachyphytum oviferum usually does not exceed 10 centimeters in
              height, forming compact rosettes that spread slowly. When it comes
              to watering care, Pachyphytum oviferum, like most succulents,
              prefers dry soils. Water only when the substrate is completely
              dry, checking the moisture with your finger or a stick. In winter,
              the watering frequency should be drastically reduced, as the plant
              enters a period of dormancy. Excess water can be fatal to this
              succulent, as its roots are susceptible to rotting.

            <hr />
            <p>
              Haworthia fasciata, popularly known as "Zebra Plant", is a compact
              succulent that stands out for its triangular, dark green leaves
              with transverse white stripes that resemble the stripes of a
              zebra, which gives it a special charm. Its leaves are thick, with
              a slightly rough texture and thin tips, arranged in rosettes that
              usually do not exceed 10-15 cm in height. As for watering care,
              Haworthia fasciata, like most succulents, prefers dry soils. Water
              only when the substrate is completely dry, checking the moisture
              with your finger or a stick. In winter, the watering frequency
              should be reduced, as the plant enters a period of dormancy.
              Excess water can be harmful to this succulent, as its roots are
              susceptible to rotting.
